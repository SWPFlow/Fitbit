To import your own modules you need to modify the 
system path from the iPython startup script found at:

/Users/Wilhelm/.ipython/profile_default/startup

Note that for efficiency reasons the python interpreter
will only load a package/module once the first time that
package/module is loaded in a new session. This means that
any subsequent changes made to the module will not take effect
in this session. You can get around this by typing:

reload(module.modulename)

into the python interpreter.
