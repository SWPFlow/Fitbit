1) To import your own modules you need to modify the 
system path from the iPython startup script found at:

/Users/Wilhelm/.ipython/profile_default/startup

Specifically, I created a file in this directory called
00-startup.py containing the following lines:

import sys,os,os.path
sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('/Users/frenchwr/Computing/Python-code/Python-Scripts/fitbit-data/Fitbit'))

2) Note that for efficiency reasons the python interpreter
will only load a package/module once the first time that
package/module is loaded in a new session. This means that
any subsequent changes made to the module will not take effect
in this session. You can get around this by typing:

reload(module.modulename)

into the python interpreter.
